# BarcodeReader

This project contains an initial setup for the testing or use of the Barcode Recognition portion of the Shape Detection API implemented in modern mobile browsers. You can read more about it here https://wicg.github.io/shape-detection-api/ and find specifications on the Barcode Detector here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BarcodeDetector

This project can be used in two ways. By downloading all files a quick start template is created. This template includes a single HTML file, a single CSS file and the main Javascript file containing the practical barcode reader functionality.
