# BarcodeReader

This project contains an initial setup for the testing or use of the Barcode Recognition portion of the Shape Detection API implemented in modern mobile browsers. You can read more about it here https://wicg.github.io/shape-detection-api/ and find specifications on the Barcode Detector here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BarcodeDetector

**Please note, that the Barcode Detector is not implemented in desktop browsers. To use Barcode Detector will require a suitable mobile device. Browser support information can be found here** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BarcodeDetector#browser_compatibility

This project can be used in two ways. By downloading all files a quick start template is created. This serves as a quick introduction to device media and the barcode detector for users looking to build a quick and performant barcode reading app. This template includes a single HTML file, a single CSS file and the main Javascript file containing the practical barcode reader functionality.

As well as handling the initation of the Barcode Detector, the barcodes.js file includes implemented methods that capture live video from your device camera and features that can improve barcode reading peformance (creating buttons to zoom in and out and access the device torch where available). Access to zoom functionality and the device torch is, of course, subject to device compatibility but works with most modern phone handsets.
